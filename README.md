# 5Week

How I started
I created a project where when the movement of the umbrella (= human hand) is detected, the angle of the rain on the area touching the umbrella changes by 45 degrees

This week, while looking at Instagram, I came across a project by an interactive developer I respect and really wanted to learn about the principles of his work and how he ran it. Therefore, my original assignment was a project to make with pixels, but I decided to proceed because I felt I needed to use an open source that detects motion.
